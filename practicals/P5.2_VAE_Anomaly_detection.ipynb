        "# Practical 5.2: Anomaly Detection with VAEs\n",
        "\n",
        "As we have seen, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a mathematically grounded framework for the unsupervised learning of latent representations. Besides interpreting VAEs as representation learning or generative modelling, we can also see them as performing (approximate) density estimation. VAEs are trained to optimise a lower bound to the (log) likelihood $\\log p(X)$ of the data $X$, under the chosen model. So, for any point in data space, we can obtain an estimate of its likelihood under the trained model, by simply computing the loss function when passing this data point through the neural network (note that the loss function is the negative ELBO, so we need to multiply by -1 to obtain a likelihood estimation).\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use this idea to perform unsupervised anomaly detection. Suppose we are given a dataset that describes some natural distribution (e.g. images of certain clothing items). For new test data, we then wish to detect whether it fits this distribution, or is significantly different (an anomaly). For example, given a dataset of shirts, we want to detect anomalies in a test data set that also contains some images of trousers. Typically, such a situation occurs when we have many examples of one class (e.g. shirts), but very few of others (the anomalies, e.g. trousers).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why generative models?\n",
        "We could describe anomaly detection as binary classification, and train typical supervised methods on data with labels (normal vs. anomaly). However, anomaly detection settings typically have high data imbalance; there are way more normal examples than anomalies. Moreover, anomalies tend to be diverse; there are many ways in which anomalous data can differ from normal data. Supervised methods often don't work well in such cases, and may overfit easily, especially on the anomaly class. Using generative models however, we can ignore the anomaly class completely during training and instead focus on modelling the normal class well. If a generative model can learn to represent normal data well, but is restrictive enough such that it won't be able to represent anomalous data well, it can be much more reliable for anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploring anomaly detection with VAEs.\n",
        "In this practical, we will perform and evaluate such anomaly detection with VAEs. Given a training data set that consists of instances that we consider \"normal\", we wish to detect anomalies in a test data set that contains both \"normal\" (but unseen) examples, as well as other examples which we consider anomalous. The idea is to train a VAE on the training data, such that it learns to represent \"normal\" data well. We can then compute the ELBO values for the test data, where ideally \"normal\" examples should obtain higher likelihood values than anomalous examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use FashionMNIST to simulate the anomaly detection task. We will omit one class from the training data, and consider the remaining 9 classes to be \"normal\". The goal is then to identify the omitted class in the test data, by comparing the ELBO values obtained from a VAE trained on 9 classes."
